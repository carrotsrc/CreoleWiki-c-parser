Creole Wiki Markup V1.0
C Parser
=======================

A parser that converts inputted creole formatted text blocks into HTML formatted text blocks.
It functions as a state machine and tracks changes per line and per text block. It logically breaks the tect block into lines which it then processes individually.

There are two different kinds of token on a line:
* Control tokens - these are reserved tokens for creole to use as formatters
* String tokens - these are your alphanumeric tokens, as well as space

note: some tokens may be within the range checked for control tokens;  they are treated as string tokens if they have no specific handling.

Each line is broken up into two or three sections:
* Control section - This is for handling tokens that may qualify the line. It is delimited by the first string token.
* String section - This will be the bulk of the line with formatting, alphanumeric, spaces. It is delimited by the end of line
* Trail Section - This is a special section that is entered if the end of the line consists of control tokens.

As formatting is encountered, the machine's flags are toggled and untoggled. There are two different kinds of flags
* Global flags - these are for when formatting is toggled over multiple lines (multiple logical breaks)
* Local flags - (or Line flags) these are for formatting that exists for the maximum duration of a line
